How 2 minecraft mod the text document:

First go get urself a nice forge mdk from http://files.minecraftforge.net/
then extract it into a folder somewhere

Then delete everything deleted in this commit right here:
https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/How2Mod/commit/d55fbaa0f6d84c91f5114053fa302e4da9bcb0f7

Now you need to go actually get the gradle wrapper again, since you just deleted 2.14 (the very old version forge ships)
https://gradle.org/releases/ Go get yourself the binary-only edition of the latest gradle.
Since this is the actual version of gradle, you'll need to do a few things to use it.

You have two options here: Either install gradle to your system, or temporarily extract and generate the wrapper files.

Since the second option is less compilated, let's go with that.

So extract the gradle zip into some folder, then run the command "gradle w" from a command prompt or command line.
then run "gradle --stop" to close the daemon so you can delete this folder later.
Now you have generated 4 files you need to go put the wrapper back in your forge workspace.

gradlew
gradlew.bat
gradle (folder)

Move those three things into the dir with your mdk and then we can get back to that. (you can then delete the old gradle folder). See commit: https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/How2Mod/commit/e4ba4e1b92751816d7267780b8f84b759cc2757b

Then if you want a bit of understanding about the build.gradle, I've changed the default comments on them because they are useless. https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/How2Mod/blob/8b52990a88a6318e68a43d540754ff70ce5218a9/build.gradle
